        Time is a distinguished dimension of spacetime that we measure with a clock, said the scientist Albert Einstein. That remark misrepresents what time really is, said the philosopher Henri Bergson, because it treats time too much like a spatial dimension and it de-emphasizes time’s relation to our consciousness.

        Information about time tells the durations of events, when events occur, and which events happen before which others, so it plays a very significant role in the universe’s structure, including the structure of our lives. However, the attempt to carefully describe time’s properties has led to many unresolved issues, both philosophical and scientific.
