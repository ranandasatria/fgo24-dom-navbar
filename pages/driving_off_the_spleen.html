        Although spleen is a physical organ in the body, it is also an old-fashioned way to describe bad-temperedness and anger. “Driving off” the spleen, then would mean chasing away or assuaging the anger. This answer fits into the broader context of the passage, in which the speaker describes how going to sea restores his good humor.
