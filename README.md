# Styling Hamburger Menu in Navbar with DOM

This project focuses on creating a navigation bar using CSS and DOM. The first version uses display: inline-block, which is then iterated to display: flex for a more flexible layout. The project also implements media queries to make the navbar responsive across different screen sizes. The HTML content uses excerpts from Moby-Dick by Herman Melville.
