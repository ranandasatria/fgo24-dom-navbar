        Cato the Younger (not to be confused with Cato the Elder) lived between 95-46 BC and vehemently opposed Julius Caesar. Benét’s Reader’s Encyclopedia and Plutarch (a famed ancient historian) support this information.
        According to Plutarch, Cato did kill himself by running himself on his own sword (it’s a bit more complicated and a bit more gruesome than that, actually). “Cato committed suicide rather than acknowledge Caesar,” (Benét’s Reader’s Encyclopedia 185).
