        The simplest theory of emotions, and perhaps the theory most representative of common sense, is that emotions are simply a class of <em>feelings</em>, differentiated by their experienced quality from other sensory experiences like tasting chocolate or proprioceptions like sensing a pain in oneâ€™s lower back. The idea that emotions are a specific kind of subjective experiences has dominated emotion theory roughly from Ancient Greece to the beginning of the twentieth century.
